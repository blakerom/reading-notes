# IMAGES

Controlling your images in CSS will affect the presentation of your HTML.

You can controll the images through CSS by affecting the width and height.

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
 }
 ```
 
 Specifying the size of your images can help your website load more quickly and appropriatley as the page does not need to wait for the images to load in order to continue loading the page. Most websites today will use pictures of all the same size to keep their website fuild.
 Aligning the images are best done using the float attribute. Other ways to utilize images are background-image and image repeating. Background images can be contained in spritesxs to help load pages even faster.
