# 02 Pair Programming

Pair programming improves the quality of code that is produced. By having a second set of eyes to catch lintr errors, broken loops, and algorithms, having another coder there to catch what the other does not pays dividends. Pair programming works in a Driver and Navigator capacity where one person types the code(drives) and the other instructs on what to type(navigator). Pair programming is especially beneeficial when learning as one coder may know or understnad a topic that the other may not. Not only does pair programming help with unfamiliar topics it helps with communication incluing coding lingo used and how its used is practiced. Pair programming improves efficiency, engages collaboration, improves social skills, and prepares you for the workplace environment. This can prove especially usefull when seeking emplyment and you have already practiced collaborating and conversing in the coding environment.
