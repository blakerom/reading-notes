# 06 Node.js
Node.js is an event-based JavaScript runtime environment that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine. The V8 engine is the same engine that runs Google Chrome. Node is installed using npm or node package management. Node has excellent JavaScript support and can run the latest and newest versions with ease. install a package locally using npm init. node_modules is a file that gets loaded to the root of your project that node uses. This file should remain on the .gitignore list so that it is not easily accessible. Node.js is event-driven and single-threaded, only reacting to an event.
### Negatives

2. Errors can crash the entire process.
3. Some may not prefer asynchromous JavaScript.

Node can be used to create a command-line tool, crud apps, chat sites, or even building API's.
