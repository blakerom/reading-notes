# Update/Delete

Client side operations use many methods. Update and delete cannot be completed by HTML therefore you need a method override to complete these tasks.
Sending form data is a part of the tasks required to update databases and push information.
Method defines how data is sent. 

```html
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
*GET* METHOD is used to ask for a given resource. Because the body is empty the imformation is appended to the url.

```html
<form action="https://www.foo.com" method="POST">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

*Post* Method sends data and expects an appropriate response.
