# 03 Flexbox and Templating

Instead of floats, use Flexbox!

Flexbox contains properties for the parent container and properties for the child containers.

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

The display defines a container, enabling flex.

#### flex-direction adjusts the direction containers will flex.
#### flex-grow defines the ability for items to grow while flexing.
#### flex-wrap decides the wrapping qualities.
#### flex-shrink just like grow but shrinks instead.
#### flex-flow is direction and wrap properties together and define the main flow.
#### flex-basis defines the default size prior to flexing.
#### justify-content allows you to justify your content horizontally in many different ways. 
  1. flex-start
  2. flex-end
  3. center
  4. space-between
  5. space-around
  6. space-evenly
#### align-self specifies the default alignment.
