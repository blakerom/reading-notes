# DM Normalization

Database Normalization is used to organize a database into tables and columns. By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the amount of duplicate data. 

### Three Reasons for Database Normalization
- Minimize duplicat data
- Avoid data modification issues
- Simplify queries

Database tables should each have one purpose. Having more than one purpose can lead to data duplication.
