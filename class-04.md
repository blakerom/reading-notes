## Links

Links define the internet. They are what takes you form one page to another. So you can imagine how importnat it is to include links within your page.

Links will include a reference class with them `href=""`that will include a link to where they are trying to go.
```html
<a href="www.google.com">Google</a>
```
This is an example of HTML for an anchor tag used to include a link to the google website.

Linking to other websites will use *Absolute* paths. 
```html
<a href="#contact">Contact</a>
```
While linking to other pages within the same site uses *Relative* paths.
```html
<a href="www.att.com">Att</a>
```
