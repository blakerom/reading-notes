# Stacks and Queues

### Stack
A stack is a data structure consisting of nodes.
Each node connects to the next node with a reference pointer.

Push - adds a node to the stack
Pop - pops the top node off of the stack
Top - top of the stack
Peek - takes a look at the top of the stack
isEmpty - checks if the stack is empty or contains nodes

Stacks follow the First In Last Out or Last In First Out

### Queue
A Queue is a like a line of nodes, the First In is the First Out or Last In Last Out. Similar to a stack but different order of operations.

Enqueue - Nodes or items are added to the queue
Dequeue - Nodes or items are removed from the queue
Front - The front of the queue, or first node
Rear - the rear or last node
Peek - takes a look at the front value of the node
isEmpty - checks the queue for items or nodes
