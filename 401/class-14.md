# Access Control

### Role Based Access Control
81% of hacking-related breaches involved compromised credentials. 
#### What is RBAC?
RBAC is nothign more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their roles within an organization.
System needs are analyzed, users grouped into roles, and access is assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment.
#### Benefits
With proper implementation RBAC access rights become systematic and repeatable. It is also much easier to audit user rights. This makes managing the access rights more maneagbale.

Access Control Lists (ACL) is a means of defininf access rights by a given user group, to an object such as a document. It can be used to allow users form one department to make changes to a document while only allowing other groups to read the document.

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use attributes such as including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access, etc. 

#### RBAC Implementatiion
1. Inventory your systems
- Figure out what resources you have that need control access.

2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
- Group your workforce members into roles witih common access needs.

3. Assign people to roles
- Figure out which roles to assign members

4. Never make one-off changes
- Resist the urge to make one-off changes for employees with unusual needs

5. Audit
- Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each.
