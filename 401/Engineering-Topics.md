# Solving a problem

Several key mistakes during interview programming problems.
- Allocation of time, don't dive right in. Spend time looking at the problem and ensuring it works. 
- Starting to code right away, this goes bak to allocation of time, plan your resolution and ensure you have a good plan before diving in.
- Understanding the problem, ask questions and make sure you fully understand the problem before starting.
- Over solving, keep it simple and make it work.


1.  Read the problem completely twice.
2.  Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3.  Optimize the manual steps.
4.  Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5.  Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6.  Optimize the real code.

As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

# Pretend your time is worth $1000/hr
busyness is laziness for the mind. 
>Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.
To be successful stay focused. Deep work means to not become distracted. Finish your work meaningfully and when you're done you're done. Enjoy the rest of the day. This will also help to avoid over working and exhaustion. 

Say no more often. Successful people say yes, while really successful people say no more often.

# Problem-Solving

The meta-skill. The best approach is having a framework and practicing it.

1. Understand the problem.
2. Plan a solution before even touching code.
3. Divide the problem into smaller more manageable solutions.


# The 5 Why's

In order to investigate a problem and get to the root cause you should use the 5 why technique to help you. This seemingly simple technique allows a team to focus and think deeply about a cause to an issue.
First identify an issue. Then, just ask why? Asking why enough times to get to the root cause but not over doing it is key. This technique will create a deep thinking process that will assist in seeing the bigger picture as well as the little details involved with an issue.
